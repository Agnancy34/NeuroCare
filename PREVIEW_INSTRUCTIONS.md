# Preview Instructions

## How to View the Preview

I've created a standalone preview file (`preview_form.html`) that you can view in your browser without running the Flask server.

### Steps to View:

1. **Locate the file**: `preview_form.html` in your project folder

2. **Open in browser**:
   - **Option A**: Double-click `preview_form.html` - it will open in your default browser
   - **Option B**: Right-click → "Open with" → Choose your browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, etc.)
   - **Option C**: Open your browser and drag & drop the file into it

3. **View the preview**: You'll see the form with:
   - New brain/stroke-themed dark background
   - All the helper text and examples
   - BMI calculator with height/weight inputs
   - All the improvements we discussed

4. **Test the form**: 
   - Fill in some sample data
   - Try the BMI calculator
   - See how everything looks and works

### Features in the Preview:

✅ **Brain-themed background**:
   - Dark blue gradient (medical theme)
   - Subtle brain pattern overlay
   - Professional medical aesthetic

✅ **All helper text and examples**:
   - Placeholders for easy input
   - Range values shown
   - Common value suggestions

✅ **BMI Calculator**:
   - Height in feet/inches OR centimeters
   - Weight in kg OR pounds
   - Automatic BMI calculation

✅ **Responsive design**:
   - Works on mobile and desktop
   - Clean, modern interface

### After Review:

- ✅ **If you like it**: Let me know and I'll update all the project files
- ❌ **If you want changes**: Tell me what to adjust and I'll modify the preview
- 🔄 **If you want different background**: I can create alternative designs

### Note:
This preview file is standalone - it won't affect your actual application. It's just for visual preview purposes.
